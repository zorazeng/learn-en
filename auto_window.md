## Goal
---

- Make an auto window.

## Materials
---

- 1 x [Smarthome kit](https://www.elecfreaks.com/estore)
- 1 x corrugated board

## Background
---
### What is an auto window ? 
-  Noise pollution is a common problem in our life. When the value of noise higher than 70dB, it is will impact our health. We will design a smart window and door using micro:bit.

### Auto window operation
- Using micro:bit detect wether the the value of noise higher than 70dB and control servo to closing the door and the window.

## Programming

### Step 1
Go to MakeCode page, click Advanced in the code block and click on Extensions.

We need to add a new codebase for programming of smart home. Finding “Add Package” in the bottom of code block and click it. Then a message box will show up, search “smart home"， and download this new codebase.

Note：If there is a hint says some codebase will be deleted because of incompatibility. Don't worry. You could go ahead as the hint or build a new item in item menu bar.


### Step 2

Drag on start on from Basic, snap into servo write pin, set P1 to 0.

### Step 3

Snap set item to into forever, assignment value of noise to noise variables.

### Step 4

If value of noise > 70dB, snap into servo write pin,set P1 to 0 and the window be closed.

### Step 5
If value of noise < 70dB，snap into servo write pin,set P1 to 100 and the window be opened.

## Result
---
micro:bit driving servo open the window when value of noise > 70dB.
